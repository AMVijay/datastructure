# Quick Sort Algorithm

Quick sort algorithm uses a pivot value to partition the input linear data structure, sort the 2 partitions based on pivot value and do this same step in recursive for both partitions.

## Algorithm Steps
* Step 1: Find a pivot value (assume it is end value). 
* Step 2: Sort the linear data structure as all lesser value elements to the left of pivot value position and greater value elements to the right of pivot value position. 
* Step 3: Follow the step 1 in recursive for the left side parition (lesser value elements of pivot value position). 
* Step 4: Follow the step 1 in recursive for the right side partition (greater value elements of pivot value position).
