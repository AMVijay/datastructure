# Bubble Sort
Bubble Sort algorithm traverse the array till the end of array and swap the values by comparing the value at index with next index value.

## Algorithm Flow/Steps
* Step 1: Iterate through the array from 0th index to till end of array index.
    * Step 1.1 : compare the value at index with next index value. 
    * Step 1.2 If it is greater, then swap the value between each index
* Step 2: Repeat the step 1 by iterating through 0th index to till end_index - 1.
