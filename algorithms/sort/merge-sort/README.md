# Merge Sort

Merge Sort is one of the efficient sorting alogorithm for linear data structure. 

## Algorithm Steps
* Step 1: Check Start Index is less than End Index. 
* Step 2: If yes, Find the middle element index of linear data structure.
* Step 3: Split the linear data structure into 2 sub collection as start to till middle element index and middle element index + 1 to till  end index of collection, then call Step 1 for both sub collection recursively. 
* Step 4: Merge the 2 collection by comparing each other values based on sorting.

## Implementation
